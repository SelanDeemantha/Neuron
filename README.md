# Neuron
This is a simple java project to show the neuron behaviour(4 inputs &amp; 1 output)
Here 16 variouse type of inputs are feeding and according to that inputs neuron is going to give 16 outputs.
There is a threshold value and it decides the output. it means output value is less than threshold, its going to assign for 0.othrwise its going to be 1.
